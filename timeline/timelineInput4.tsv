Hurricane Maria	Hurricane Maria was a devastating Category 4 storm that made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, causing widespread destruction and triggering a prolonged humanitarian crisis. The storm severely damaged infrastructure, collapsed the power grid, and resulted in nearly 3,000 deaths. It also caused extensive environmental impacts, including deforestation, coastal erosion, and widespread damage to coral reefs and marine ecosystems.	image	Maria.jpg	hurricane.svg	09-20-2017	caribbean		
Major Red Tide Events	The 2017–2019 red tide bloom in Florida was one of the most prolonged and intense harmful algal bloom (HAB) events in recent history. Caused by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis, the bloom persisted for over 16 months and affected more than 400 miles of coastline, primarily along the southwest coast. It resulted in massive fish kills, the deaths of hundreds of marine mammals and sea turtles, and significant respiratory irritation for coastal residents and tourists. The event also caused widespread economic losses due to beach closures, reduced tourism, and impacts on commercial fisheries. Environmental stressors such as warm water temperatures, nutrient runoff, and calm ocean conditions likely contributed to the bloom’s severity and duration.	image	Copy of NCCOS - Red-tide-off-Little-Gasparilla-Island-FL-credit-Paul Schmidt.jpg	null	11-01-2017	florida	Paul Schmidt	
Port of Miami Deep Dredge	The Port of Miami Deep Dredge project, completed between 2013 and 2015, deepened the shipping channel to accommodate larger vessels following the Panama Canal expansion.

Global Coral Bleaching	The 2014–2017 global coral bleaching event, affected over 70% of the world’s coral reefs. Triggered by prolonged ocean warming and a strong El Niño, it caused severe and repeated bleaching across the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. Many reefs, including those in the Great Barrier Reef, Hawaii, and the Caribbean, experienced extensive coral mortality, with limited time for recovery between bleaching episodes.	image	2014bleach.jpg	null	01-01-2014	all

Goliath Grouper Open for Limited Harvest	In 2023, FWC reopened the harvest of goliath grouper for the first time in US waters since the moratorium in the 1990s. Each year, fishers can pay $10 to enter the lottery where names are randomly drawn to select the 200 tag ‘winners.’  If selected, the cost for the tag is $150 for in-state residents and $500 for out-of-state fishers.  The allowable harvest period for tag holders is between March 1st and May 31st in designated waters. Goliath grouper can only be harvested if they are within the specified 24 – 36 inch (61 – 91 cm) slot.	image	fwcGoliath.jpg	fishing_boat.svg	01-01-2023	florida		Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission
